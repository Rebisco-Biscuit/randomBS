### **Achievements:**
  - successfully created insert
  - nodes can have their previous links
  - still learning insert at pos

### **Sajested objectives:**
  - Insert at Position: Write a function that inserts a node at any specific position in the list. This requires traversing the list and adjusting pointers at the insertion point.
  - Delete from Position: Similar to insertion, try deleting a node from any position in the list. Practice handling edge cases, like deleting from the head or tail.
  - Reverse the List: Create a function to reverse the linked list by switching the next and previous pointers. Practice updating head and tail as well.
  - Sorting the List: Implement a sort function, like bubble sort or insertion sort, directly within the linked list. Practice with both ascending and descending order.
  - Find Middle Node: Write a function to find the middle node in a single traversal (using the two-pointer approach, for instance).
  - Remove Duplicates: If you allow duplicates in your list, write a function to remove them.
  - Merge Two Lists: Try merging two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list without using extra space.

ALL OF THESE SHOULD BE DONE. ~~otherwise my lord Aizen would be disappointed and I don't want that </3~~
